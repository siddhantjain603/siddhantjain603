# 👋 Siddhant Jain

## 💫 About Me
I’m an AI/ML Engineer specializing in **Generative AI and multi-agent systems**, with hands-on experience designing and deploying **production-grade LLM workflows**.

My work focuses on **LLM orchestration, tool-based agents, and memory-driven architectures** using **LangGraph, LangChain, MCP, and Autogen**, backed by scalable **Azure infrastructure** (Functions, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, App Service).

I build systems where LLMs don’t just respond — they **reason, delegate tasks, invoke tools, coordinate with other agents, and operate with human-in-the-loop control**. I care deeply about **system design, latency, reliability, and real-world constraints**, not demo-only prototypes.

Currently at **Accenture**, I work on improving GenAI system performance, architecture, and developer usability, while evaluating emerging multi-agent frameworks for enterprise adoption.

## 🧩 Currently Exploring

I’m currently learning **n8n** to design and implement **automation workflows** that connect APIs, tools, and AI systems.

My focus is on building **practical automation flows** that integrate LLM-driven decision-making with real-world services, moving beyond manual orchestration toward reusable, event-driven pipelines.  
I’ll be publishing **hands-on projects** as these workflows mature into production-style use cases.
